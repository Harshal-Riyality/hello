		<p>The word nature is borrowed from the Old French nature and is derived from the Latin word natura, or "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth".[5] In ancient philosophy, natura is mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek word physis (φύσις), which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics of plants, animals, and other features of the world to develop of their own accord.[6][7] The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is one of several expansions of the original notion;[2] it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις by pre-Socratic philosophers (though this word had a dynamic dimension then, especially for Heraclitus), and has steadily gained currency ever since.</p>

			<a href="" class="i"><i class="fa fa-folder-open">BLOGS</i></a>
			<p>In order for any plant to grow and flourish to its full potential, it needs the right conditions. The soil is all important. Everything grows in the soil. If the soil is good and you have the right amount of sunshine and water everything takes care of itself. Nature follows its own course. We don’t…</p>

			<a href="" class="i"><i class="fa fa-folder-open">BLOGS</i></a>
			<p>A number of years ago I went on holiday to a beautiful part of Portugal. We stayed in a converted farmhouse in the middle of a national park. The farmhouse was in a valley. We arrived in the evening when the birds were just starting to roost. It was still warm and the air smelled…</p>

			<p>“Nature is not a place to visit. It is home.” – Gary Snyder In a very real sense, mountains and valleys, the seas and the skies, the sun and the earth, the trees and the flowers constitute our home, our natural habitat. Growing up in the modern developed world we can easily come to believe…</p>

			<a href="" class="i"><i class="fa fa-folder-open">BLOGS</i></a>
			<p>As I sit outside under an old plane tree that I know very well, I get the sense that summer is slowly coming to a close. A feeling accompanies this realisation. A sinking, uncomfortable feeling that I know all too well. It is the same feeling that comes on Sunday evenings as another week in…</p>

			<a href="" class="i"><i class="fa fa-folder-open">BLOGS</i></a>
			<p>The world is animated by the wind. This invisible, mysterious force can bring a landscape alive. Its absence can cast a calm stillness over the earth. On barren mountain tops its power is barely perceptible; in forests and seas its presence becomes manifest. Winds are wild, and sometimes destructive. When we look deeply into the…</p>

			<p>How surely gravity’s law, strong as an ocean current, takes hold of even the strongest thing and pulls it toward the heart of the world. Each thing- each stone, blossom, child – is held in place. Only we, in our arrogance, push out beyond what we belong to for some empty freedom. If we surrendered…</p>
